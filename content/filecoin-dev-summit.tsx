    "FIL Dev Summit is a gathering of developers, builders, and engaged community members who want to contribute to the core protocol and network evolution of Filecoin (think IPFS Thing, but bigger!). This summit is more than just a meetupâ€”it's a place for meaningful and impactful conversations that help push Filecoin forward. Discussions at the summit will cover a wide range of topics, from protocol scalability and network improvements to the intricacies of data onboarding and governance structures. These conversations serve to share and refine improvements - where participants can gain insights from diverse perspectives, challenge assumptions, and collectively arrive at innovative solutions to the challenges faced by the Filecoin ecosystem.",
